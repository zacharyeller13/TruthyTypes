# TruthyTypes

A simple class library to wrap built-in types (int, char, etc.) with custom types that are truthy/falsy.

## Why?

Why not?

I was working on some Python code and thought "Could I shoehorn truthiness into the C# built-in types?"

This dumb, useless class library was born out of that.

Should I or anyone else ever use this for real? Most definitely not.  But I'm having fun with it anyway.
